# Educational Python Script to Demonstrate File Manipulation and Script Self-Replication

This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the mechanics of file manipulation and script self-replication in Python.  
**This script is intended strictly for educational use in a controlled environment.**

## Objectives

- Understand how Python can interact with the file system.
- Learn the principles of script self-replication.
- Emphasize the ethical considerations and responsibilities in software development.
